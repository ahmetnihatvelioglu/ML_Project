# ML_Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing various machine learning algorithms for data analysis and prediction. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
**To run this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. You can install the required dependencies using:**

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

**Alternatively, you can install the following packages individually:**

"pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter"

## Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations

**Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance

**Model Selection**: Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms

**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better results

**Model Evaluation**: Using various metrics to assess model performance

## Models

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Linear Regression

- Decision Trees


## Results

In this project, Forest Fire Index (FWI) was estimated using Algerian forest fires dataset. Our aim is to accurately estimate the FWI value by analyzing the environmental factors affecting fire risk. In this direction, multiple linear regression and decision tree regression models were trained and their performances were compared.

### Data Preprocessing and Key Findings:

- The dataset was subjected to various pre-processing steps such as cleaning missing values ​​and converting categorical variables to numerical format.

- Correlation analysis revealed the relationships between the features and identified the key factors associated with FWI.

- Feature Engineering:

  The columns 'day', 'month' and 'year' were removed as they were unnecessary for the analysis.

  Categorical columns were converted to numerical data.
